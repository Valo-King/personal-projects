The lab environment is a small mockup of a Gen 1 datacenter. In it, I have led a team of three other students in building, establishing and configuring a physical network utilizing Ethernet. The network served eight Windows 10 PCs, and is routing using Cisco 2960-X and Cisco 2960 Plus devices. From this point, the team split and began doing things seperately while we helped each other understand what we weren't getting. I setup an Arch Linux server and used it as an SSH server to remotely manage a UNIX-like environment. Groups, daemons, ownership and users ahoy, and I was able to access it through the Windows machines that were already configured.

When configuring the network, I edited the configuration of the networking equipment using a Windows 10 machine utilizing PuTTY to access the serial console interface. I configured several VLANs to segregate traffic, keeping individual student environments individual. I assisted several of my fellow classmates in the project, aiding them in installing or configuring the network.

After the physical configuration of the network was completed, I stepped away from the brunt of the work to pursue my Security+ certification. After my cycle of study was completed and I passed my test, I configured a hardware controlled RAID and installed Arch Linux to a server, intending to utilize OpenSSH to remotely access the server. At first, I utilized password logons, but then I studied available documentation and guides to implement key authorization.
